                            They are very loving and care for me always. My father is Abu shayeed joarder and my mother
                            is
                            Shahida pervin. My father is an architect and is a great designer. He is a very kind and
                            hardworking person. He loves me very much and takes care of all my needs. Sometimes he
                            brings
                            beautiful gifts for me. He takes me out and fills my life with happiness and joy. He even
                            teaches me at home and helps me complete my homework. My mother is a homemaker and is very
                            caring too. She takes great care of the house and cooks tasty food for all of us. She takes
                            me
                            to school in the morning and to the park in the evening. She tells me interesting stories at
                            bedtime. I am very dear to my parents. I love and respect them very much too. I do not know
                            what
                            to do without my parents. When I grow up I too will take care of them.</font>
